**Abstract**

Image captioning is a research area of immense importance, aiming to generate natural language descriptions for visual content in the form of still images.  What makes it even more interesting is that it brings together both Computer Vision and NLP. The advent of deep learning and more recently vision-language pre-training and attention techniques has revolutionized the field, leading to more sophisticated methods and improved performance. In this paper, we answer some of the most important research questions related to (i) the replacement of VGG-16 with the inception-v3 model for extracting image features and (ii) the inclusion of vision attention while training the model for Image Captioning. This paper will try to answer the questions by detailing two different model training approaches for the Image Captioning task.

**1  Introduction** 

1. **Research Questions** 
- Evaluation  of  Multi-Modal  Architectures: In the context of image captioning, how does the “merge” architecture, which allows independent operation of the Image Encoder and Sequence Decoder, compare to the traditional “Inject” architecture in terms of captioning accuracy and efficiency? 
- Comparison of Image Encoder Architectures: What is the impact of using different image encoder  architectures, such  as  VGGNet  and  Inception,  on  the  quality  and  informativeness  of  the  encoded  representations  in  image captioning?
- Bleu  Score  Metric  for  Model  Evaluation: How well does the Bleu Score metric, as mentioned in the article, align with human evaluation in assessing the quality of generated image captions, and how does it compare to other evaluation metrics commonly used in NLP applications? 
- Effectiveness  of  Attention  Mechanisms:  How does the integration of attention mechanisms enhance the performance of image captioning models compared to models without attention mechanisms? 
2. **What is Image Captioning?** 

Image Captioning is the task of describing the content of an image in words. This task lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing.  This field of research deals with the creation of textual descriptions for images without human intervention. Given an input image I, the goal is to generate a caption C describing the visual contents present inside the given image, with C being a set of sentences C = c1, c2, ..., cn where each ci is a sentence of the generated caption C. Most image captioning systems use an encoder-decoder framework, where an input image is encoded into an intermediate representation of the information in the image, and then decoded into a descriptive text sequence. The most popular benchmarks are nocaps and COCO, and models are typically evaluated according to a BLEU or CIDER metric. However, for our experiments, we opted to work with the Flickr-8k dataset due to the following reasons:- 

- Task Alignment: Our research questions are narrowly focussed on Model Configuration and Architecture for Image Captioning Problems, which can be answered by performing experiments leveraging the Flickr dataset and don’t require such large datasets like COCO and nocaps that are computationally expensive and require certain ethical considerations for working on them. 
- Smaller  Scale:  Since our objective is to study different model development approaches of image captioning and not to produce any state-of-the-art Image Captioning model for the industry, preferring large datasets like COCO and nocaps would  have  been  computationally  too  expensive.  Considering  concerns  related  to  computational  resources  and  time 

  constraints, training, and evaluating models on smaller datasets seemed more feasible for our research setting. 

- Previous  Successful  Usage:  The  Flickr  dataset  stands  as  the  preferred  choice  for  researchers  delving  into  image captioning challenges. Its widespread adoption and extensive usage in numerous studies make it a cornerstone in the realm of image captioning research. The dataset’s prominence is underscored by a plethora of existing research works that have exclusively leveraged the Flickr dataset, highlighting its efficacy and relevance in advancing our understanding of image captioning models. 
3. **Flickr Dataset** 

The Flickr dataset has become a standard benchmark for sentence-based image description. There are two widely used variants of this dataset named Flickr-30k and Flickr-8k. The Flickr-30k dataset contains 31,000 images[1] collected from Flickr, together with 5 reference sentences provided by human annotators whereas the Flickr-8k dataset contains 8092 images and up to five captions for 

each  image.  Such  annotations  are  essential  for  continued  progress  in  automatic  image  description  and  grounded  language understanding. They enable us to define a new benchmark for the localization of textual entity mentions in an image. For our study, we used the Flickr-8k dataset due to computational and time constraints.  However, our study can be directly applied to Flick-30k as well due to its similarity with the Flickr-8k dataset.

4. **Experimental Setup** 

For performing our experiments, we used a Python 3 Google Compute Engine GPU Machine** containing 12.7GB of RAM, 72.8 GB of Disk Memory, and a T4 GPU. 

**2  Deep Learning Based Image Captioning** 

Figure 2 below presents different frameworks, methods, and approaches that were extensively used in recent research works based on their core structure. [2] 

For our study, we experimented with 2 approaches i.e. (a) Convolutional network-based and (b) Attention-based. Following are the main steps that are performed in our experiments of training Image Captioning Models:- 

1. Data  Extraction  and  EDA:- We took the Flickr-8k Dataset from the Kaggle and performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to thoroughly understand the data and its structure. We have mainly two types of data i.e. Images and Captions (Text). The total size of the training vocabulary is 8485. 
1. Data  Cleaning:- This step involves removing certain noisy images and captions. For our experiments, we removed all words with lengths less than 2 from our training data.  Later we also eliminated words with the lowest frequency of occurrence from our training data captions in the Attention-based model. We also  remove  any  special  symbols  and numbers from the training caption data. 
1. Loading  the  training  set:-  This  step  involved  loading  our  data  in  a  dictionary  keeping  the  image names as keys and their corresponding captions in list format as values. Later we randomly shuffle these key-value mappings(dictionary) and split our data into training and testing sets by keeping 90% of the data for training and the rest 10% for testing. 
1. Image  Feature  Encoding:- In this step, we first resize our images and then leverage the transfer learning approach to prepare our Image Feature Encoder.  It takes the source photo as input and produces an encoded representation of it that captures its essential features.

![](Aspose.Words.4cb4a8e5-eea2-4fd8-922b-0362d671eb6b.006.png)

**Figure 3:** Image Feature Encoding 

This uses a CNN architecture and is usually done using transfer learning. We take a CNN model that was pre-trained for image classification and removed the final section which is the ‘classifier’.  There are several such models like VGGNet, ResNet, and Inception. It is the “backbone” of the Image Captioning Model which progressively extracts various features from the photo and generates a compact feature map that captures the most important elements in the picture. For example, it starts by extracting simple geometric shapes like curves and semi-circles in the initial layers, later progressing to higher-level structures such as noses, eyes, and hands, and eventually identifying elements such as faces and wheels.[3], [4] 

5. Sequence Decoder: This takes the encoded representation of the photo and outputs a sequence of tokens that describes the photo.  Typically this is a Recurrent Neural Network model consisting of a stack of LSTM layers fed by an Embedding layer.[4] It takes the image-encoded feature vector as its initial state and is seeded with a  minimal input sequence consisting of only a ‘Start’ token.  It ‘decodes’ the input image vector and outputs a sequence of tokens. It generates this prediction in a loop, outputting one token at a time which is then fed back to the network as input for the next iteration. Therefore at each step, it takes the sequence of tokens predicted so far and generates the next token in the sequence. Finally, it outputs an ‘End’ token which completes the sequence.[4] 
5. Data Preparation for Model Training: Using the dictionary mapping of Image Name and their corresponding captions prepared in Step-2, the Image Feature Encoder prepared in Step-4 and the Sequence Decoder prepared in Step-5 prepare the final input data for model training in the form of different arrays storing Image Encoded Features, Word Features extracted from Sequence Decoder and Caption(encoded  as  categorical  outputs  with  several  categories  equal  to  the  length  of vocabulary). These three arrays will be used to train our final Image Captioning model.[4] 
5. Model  Architecture: The Inject architecture was the original architecture for Image Captioning and  is still very popular.  However, an alternative called Merge architecture has been found to produce better results.  Rather than connecting the Image Encoder as the input of the Sequence Decoder sequentially, the two components operate independently of each other. In other words, we don’t mix the two modes ie. images with text.[4]

**Figure 4:** Mapping image features with text sequences 

1) The CNN network processes only the image and 
1) The LSTM network operates only on the sequence generated so far. 

The outputs of these two networks are then combined with a Multimodal layer (which could be a Linear and Softmax layer). It does the job of interpreting both outputs and is followed by the Sentence Generator that produces the final predicted caption. 

8. Word Embeddings: In NLP, word embeddings are numerical representations of words within a large vector space. They aim to  capture  semantic  and  syntactic  similarities  between  words  based  on  their  contextual  usage in a corpus.  For our experiments, we started with using Glove-50 embeddings but later trusted on TensorFlow Tokenizer word indexes due to the following reasons:- 
1) Task Alignment:  For the specific task of image captioning, the language context doesn’t require highly intricate relationships  between  words,  and  TensorFlow  Tokenizer  word  indexes  seemed  sufficient  to  achieve  good performance without the need for complex word embeddings like GloVe at least during the experimentation phase. In the production environment, we can use sophisticated embeddings like Glove. 
1) Resource  Efficiency  and  Training  Speeds:  The  use  of  TensorFlow  Tokenizer  could  potentially lead to faster training times as it eliminates the extra computational overhead associated with handling and processing pre-trained embeddings like GloVe. 
9. Inference: In the inference stage of both experiments, the trained model was loaded to generate captions for images by predicting the next word in a sequence using consistent preprocessing, tokenization, and word indexing methods. 
1) Preprocessing  Consistency:  The  inference  stage  meticulously  employed  sequence  generation  techniques.  It utilized the trained model to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words, employing techniques like Greedy Search or Beam Search to generate coherent captions. 
1) Tokenization  and  Word  Indexing:  The  tokenizer’s  word  indexing  process  was  replicated  during  inference, converting textual data into machine-readable sequences, ensuring the model’s compatibility with the input data format it was trained on, and later converting the output numerical sequence back to their respective word sequences leveraging same word-index mappings. 
10. Evaluation:- For evaluating the performance of our Image Captioning models in both experiments we  relied on the BLEU Score metric as it is one of the most popular metrics for NLP applications. It is a simple metric and measures the number of sequential words that match between the predicted and the ground truth caption. It compares n-grams of various lengths from 1 through 4 to do this. For example:- Predicted  Caption: “A dog stands on green grass” Ground Truth  Caption: “The dog is standing on the grass” BLEU  Score for  1-gram = Correctly Predicted Words / Total predicted Words Three predicted words also occur in the true caption ie. “dog”, “on” and “grass”, out of a total of six predicted words. BLEU  Score  for  1-gram  (ie.   single  words) = 3/6 = 0.5

All the steps we discussed are common among both of our approaches. Now in the next sections let’s discuss the architectural decisions and hyperparameter optimizations for both of our approaches. 

**3  Approach-1: Image Captioning with CNN-based Model** 

1. **VGG-16 for Image Encoding** 

In our first approach, we used VGG-16 as an image encoder to extract image  features.  VGG16 is an object detection and classification  algorithm  that  can  classify  1000  images  of  1000 different  categories  with  92.7%  accuracy.  VGG-16  is  often preferred for transfer learning applications because it generalizes well to a variety of tasks.  Its simple structure allows for easy adaptation to new datasets.  In VGG16 there are thirteen 3x3 convolutional layers, five Max Pooling layers, and three Dense layers which sum up to 21 layers but it has only sixteen weight layers i.e., layers with learnable parameters. It takes input images of shape (224,224,3) where 224,224 is the size of the image with 3 color channels i.e.  RGB images.  We extracted features from VGG-16 by removing the last fully connected(dense) layers responsible for the classification and prediction, because our main goal was to extract more abstract and semantically meaningful image features for captioning instead of performing any high-level class prediction. Also, make sure to save the encoded image feature vector in a .pkl form or .npy form for further processing as it is a time-consuming task.[3], [5] 

2. **Image Feature and Sequence Feature Fusion for Decoder** 

The LSTM-based decoder is responsible for generating coherent sequences of words that form captions based on the extracted image features. Let’s discuss this step-by-step: 

1. Image  Feature  Extraction:  The encoder processed the input image through the VGG-16 model, resulting in a feature vector representing the image as discussed above. 
1. Sequence Feature Extraction:  Now the captioning sequence is processed by an Embedding layer followed by an LSTM layer.  The Embedding layer converts  word indices  into  dense  vectors, facilitating  meaningful representation.  Also, dropout layers are incorporated to mitigate overfitting. 
1. Fusion  of  Features:  The features extracted from both the image and the sequence are concatenated (using the add function), merging the visual information from the image with the contextual information from the generated sequence. 

We used data generators for producing sequential pairs (X1, X2) as input and (y) as output, where X1 is Image Features(from VGG-16), X2 is Word Features(from TensorFlow Tokenizer), and y is the caption. We processed data in this way to facilitate the training of the model to predict the next word in a sequence.  The generator also handles the padding of input sequences to a fixed length, ensuring consistency in input size.  Producing sequential pairs on the fly was not the only reason for using data generators.  Another reason was to prevent memory exhaustion.  Generating batches on the fly reduces the memory footprint, preventing potential memory exhaustion issues, especially when dealing with large datasets as for large datasets, loading the entire dataset into memory was not feasible.  The data generator allowed the model to process data in smaller, manageable batches, preventing any type of session crashes while model training due to memory exhaustion.[6] 

3. **Decoder** 

In the decoder, we added 2 dense layers, the first dense layer with ReLU activation was added after the feature fusion, to capture complex  relationships  between  the  image  features  and  the  generated  sequence.  The  second  dense  layer,  with  a  softmax activation, was added to generate the probability distribution over the vocabulary, to determine the likelihood of each word in the vocabulary for being the next word in the sequence. 

4. **Model Compilation and Training** 
- **Loss Function and Optimizer:**  Our model is expected to perform multi-class classification tasks, so we compiled our model using categorical cross-entropy loss function which is the most suitable option for such tasks. Also, we chose Adam Optimizer to enable efficient weight updates. 
- **Training:**  The training process involves feeding the batches of image and sequence pairs through the model optimizing the parameters per computed loss. We also used callbacks like EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting and ModelCheckpoint to save the best-performing model. 

We trained our model for 132 epochs in total and made multiple hyperparameter optimizations during training. 

![](Aspose.Words.4cb4a8e5-eea2-4fd8-922b-0362d671eb6b.008.jpeg)

**Figure 5:** Training Model Architecture for Approach-1 

- **Epochs and Batch Size:**  While training, we trained the first 34 epochs of our model with a batch size of 64. Then we trained the next 40 epochs with a batch size of 32 and the last 58 epochs with a batch size of 16. We opted for this progressive training strategy intentionally as starting with larger batch sizes and gradually reducing them allowed the model to benefit from both the efficiency of larger batches (faster convergence) and the fine-tuning capabilities of smaller batches (better generalization). 
- **EarlyStopping:** Early stopping was implemented with the patience of 2 epochs initially later increasing it to 6 epochs in the hope of targeting more loss reduction.  Training stops automatically if there is no reduction in loss in 6 consecutive epochs. 
5. **Model Performance Evaluation and Results** 

We evaluated the performance of our model by computing the BLEU score metric for 1 gram and 2 grams on test data with random images, whose results are as follows: 

- BLEU−1:  0 . 486157 ![](Aspose.Words.4cb4a8e5-eea2-4fd8-922b-0362d671eb6b.009.png)
- BLEU−2: 0 . 263054 
- BLEU−3: 0 . 156096 
- BLEU−4: 0 . 088182 

Also, we wrote inference code to test the performance of our model manually on random images, whose results are as follows:

**Figure 6:**  Output captions for some sample images from Approach-1 Model 

**4  Approach-2: Image Captioning with Attention-based model** 

1. **Inception-v3 for Image Encoding** 

In this approach, we relied on Inception-v3 as our image encoder to extract image features. Similar to VGG16, Inception-v3 is also an object detection and classification algorithm and was introduced during ImageNet Recog- nition Challenge.  It is the third edition of Google’s Inception Convolutional Neural Network.  The design of Inception-v3 allows deeper networks while also keeping the number of parameters from going too large. It has under 25 million trainable parameters compared to 138 million in VGG-16.[3], [4] Our intention behind shifting from VGG-16 to Inception-v3 was multi-scale feature extraction. Since Inception-v3 utilizes inception modules with multiple filter sizes, it enables the model to capture information at different scales within the same layer. Therefore, we extracted feature vectors using inception-v3 to extract features from images at various scales i.e. improved feature vectors.  It takes input images of shape (299,299,3) where 299,299 is the size of the image with 3 color channels i.e.  RGB images.  We extracted features from Inception-v3 by removing the last fully connected(dense) layer which is mainly responsible for the classification task’s output, because our main goal was to extract more abstract and semantically meaningful image features for captioning instead of performing any classification. Also, save the encoded image feature vector in a .npy form for further processing. Then we pass the extracted image features through a dense layer to transform them into a suitable format for attention mechanism processing. The output from this dense layer will be the output of our encoder. 

2. **Attention Mechanism** 

The purpose of the attention mechanism is to allow the model to dynamically focus on different parts of the image during the caption generation process.  We implemented the attention mechanism as a separate layer, referred to as BahdanauAttention. It takes encoded image features from the encoder and the previous hidden state from the decoder as inputs to compute attention weights, indicating the importance of different parts of the image for the current decoding step.  These attention weights are further used to create a context vector, considering the weighted sum of the encoded image features. Let’s discuss how Bahdanau Attention works inbrief.[7], [8]

![](Aspose.Words.4cb4a8e5-eea2-4fd8-922b-0362d671eb6b.014.jpeg)

**Figure 7:** Inception-v3 Model Architecture 

- Bahdanau Attention Mechanism:  Deriving its name from the first author of the paper in which it was published, the most important distinguishing feature of this approach from the basic encoder-decoder is that it does not attempt to encode a whole input sentence into a single fixed-length vector.  Instead, it encodes the input sentence into a sequence of vectors and chooses a subset of these vectors adaptively while decoding the translation.[8] 
3. **Decoder** 

The purpose of the decoder is to generate captions based on the encoded image features and the attention- weighted  context vector.  The decoder is an LSTM-based recurrent neural network (RNN) that processes the attention-weighted image features and the previously generated words to predict the next word in the caption sequence. It consists of an embedding layer to convert the input word indices into continuous vector representations.  The LSTM layer processes the sequential input, maintaining a hidden state that captures context information. It is then followed by a fully connected layer, transforming the LSTM output into the final vocabulary distribution for the next word prediction. Here also we utilized a data generator to handle training data in batches, preventing memory issues and improving computational efficiency.  This generator ensures diverse samples are used for training without overwhelming system resources.  It is an important step every time we deal with large datasets to prevent any memory issues and improve overall computational efficiency.[6]

**Figure 8:**  Structure depicting how all components are working jointly 

4. **Model Compilation and Training** 
- **Loss Function and Optimizer:**  We used the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function for our model as it is suitable for multi-class classification tasks. For optimization we used Adam to adaptively adjust learning rates, leading to faster convergence and better generalization. 
- **Training:**  The training process involves feeding the batches of image and sequence pairs through the model optimizing the parameters per the computed loss. 

We trained our model for 140 epochs in total. For this approach also we performed certain hyperparameter optimizations: 

- **Epochs and Batch Size:**  For training we first trained the model with a batch size of 128, but it was not giving optimal results. So we reduced the batch size to 64 later and trained the model for 140 epochs. 
- **RNN unit:**  We also experimented with different numbers of rnn decoding units. 
5. **Model Performance Evaluation and Results** 

We evaluated the performance of our model by computing the BLEU score metric for 1 gram and 2 grams on test data with random images. whose results are as follows: 

- BLEU−1:  0 . 646201 ![](Aspose.Words.4cb4a8e5-eea2-4fd8-922b-0362d671eb6b.016.png)
- BLEU−2: 0 . 537954 
- BLEU−3: 0 . 455301 
- BLEU−4: 0 . 380474 

Also, we wrote inference code to test the performance of our model manually on random images. We deliberately tested our model for some same images on which we tested the model trained in approach-1 to analyze and compare the performance, whose results are as follows:

**Table 1:** Comparing two Approaches of training Image Captioning Model 

On comparing the performance of both of our approaches our first approach i.e. CNN-based approach and the second approach i.e. Attention Based approach, it’s visible that the second approach outperformed the first ap- proach based on BLEU score results. The simplicity of the model in the first approach allows for faster training, but its inherent sequential processing may cause context blindness, limiting its ability to capture intricate details and relationships in complex images. On the contrary, the second approach inducts  the  Bahdanau  Attention  Mechanism  into  the  encoder-decoder  architecture.  This  enhancement  allows  the  model  to dynamically focus on specific regions of the image during caption generation, providing selective attention. The attention mech- anism  significantly  improves  the  model’s  context  understanding,  enabling  it  to  capture  fine-grained  details  and  intricate relationships between objects in the image. However, this enhancement comes at the cost of increased complexity and potentially longer training times compared to the non-attention model. 

Another reason behind the second model’s capability of capturing small details in images could be the use of Inception-v3 architecture for extracting image features. As we discussed before we shifted from VGG-16 in the first approach to Inception-v3 in the second approach for better image features as inception is known for capturing multi-scale features from images. So, it seems that inception-v3 played its role successfully. [9]

**Table 2:** Comparison of our model(Flickr-8k) with other State Of The Art Image Captioning models(COCO) 

While observing and analyzing the above table, one important factor should be kept in mind: all of the state-of- the-art models were trained on the COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) dataset, whereas we used the Flickr-8k dataset for our study. The size difference between the Flickr-8k and COCO datasets is enormous, with the COCO dataset containing 328K images with 5 captions per image compared to the Flickr dataset’s  8k images. Still, to demonstrate the competence of our trained model and to justify our choice of architecture, hyperparameter values, and data preprocessing steps, we showcased this comparison, as our model was able to climb up in the state-of-the-art rankings with a comparatively smaller dataset. 

**6  Future Work and Improvements** 

Apart from training our model on large datasets like COCO, we will integrate CLIP encoding for Visual Language Understanding. CLIP which stands for Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training is a neural network that efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language supervision.  CLIP can be applied to any visual classification benchmark by simply providing the names of the visual categories to be recognized, similar to the  “zero-shot”  capabilities  of  GPT-2  and  GPT-3.  We  will  incorporate  CLIP encoding as a prefix to the caption with the motive of enriching vision-language understanding.  We will use a mapping network to integrate CLIP features and fine-tune language models for generating image captions.[10] 

**7  Conclusion** 

In conclusion, our exploration into different approaches for training image captioning models has unveiled valuable insights to improve  accuracy  and  model  resilience.  We  trained  to  merge  architecture  and  discussed  its  comparison  with  “Inject” architectures.  We  observed  that  the  “Merge”  architecture,  by  decoupling  the  encoding  and  decoding  processes,  can  yield improvements in captioning accuracy and efficiency. This approach mallowed for more flexible interactions between the image and language modalities, enabling the model to capture intricate relationships and enhance overall performance. 

We  also  investigated  the  impact  of  two  image  encoder  architectures,  VGGNet  and  Inception,  on  the  quality  and informativeness of encoded representations. The findings underscored the significance of the choice of the encoder, with Inception demonstrating superior performance. The multi-scale features extracted by Inception contributed to more detailed and contextually relevant captions, showcasing the importance of selecting an image encoder architecture considering the complexities of the image dataset. 

Furthermore, for evaluating our model’s performance, the BLEU Score metric emerged as a robust measure for assessing the quality of generated image captions. Our study revealed that the BLEU Score metric aligns well with human evaluation, offering a quantitative means to gauge captioning accuracy. Its efficacy was observed in capturing the semantic similarity between predicted and actual captions, providing a reliable benchmark for model evaluation in image captioning. 

Lastly, the integration of attention mechanisms marked a pivotal advancement in enhancing the performance of image captioning models. The second approach, leveraging attention mechanisms, outshone the first by dynamically focusing on specific regions of the image during caption generation.  This strategic attention allocation facilitated a more comprehensive understanding of image content, allowing the model to capture finer details and nuances.  The attention mechanism’s ability to address context blindness and selectively attend to relevant visual cues significantly contributed to the overall improvement in captioning quality. 

In conclusion, our scientific paper delves into the intricate nuances of multi-modal architectures, image encoder selections, evaluation metrics, and the integration of attention mechanisms in image captioning models. Hopefully, insights gained from these investigations will offer valuable guidance for designing robust and effective image captioning systems, bridging the gap between visual content and natural language descriptions.  The conclusions drawn from each research question collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the key factors influencing the performance and efficiency of image captioning models.
